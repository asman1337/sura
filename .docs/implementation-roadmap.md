## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complex Hierarchy Implementation**: Start with simplified models and iteratively improve
- **Dual Reporting Paths Complexity**: Carefully design the database schema to support both IC PS and OC PS structures
- **Performance Issues with Large Data**: Implement pagination and efficient queries from the beginning
- **Mobile Offline Sync Challenges**: Begin offline feature development early to allow thorough testing

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strictly prioritize features based on core functionality first
- **Integration Challenges**: Regular integration testing throughout development
- **Time Constraints**: Buffer weeks built into the schedule for unexpected challenges

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully model both District Police and Commissionerate hierarchies with n-level depth
2. Support multiple officers in charge of units with different role types
3. Support multiple managers for departments with different responsibilities
4. Properly manage and visualize complex hierarchical relationships
5. Maintain historical record of officers' assignments across units and departments
6. Multi-tenant isolation prevents cross-organization data access
7. Mobile app works seamlessly with complex hierarchy data
8. System can handle the expected user load with good performance
