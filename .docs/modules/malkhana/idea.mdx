Malkhana is a way to store things in police deparetment.
red ink and black ink.

all things which are getting registered in the current year, are black ink.
and among them some gets disposed/moved out, rest forwarded to red ink registry in next wear.,

black ink registry means current year(for exmaple 2024), if it is not disponsed/moved out, it goes to red ink when 2025 starts and 2025 will be the black ink that year.

red ink is a historic record and it's possible we have 100 item in red ink, then for example item 50 go disposed disposed then 51 wil moved to 50, 52 to 51 and so on.
and think in 2024 black register we have 10 item then when 2025 starts, that 10 black will be moved to red and will be 99 + 10
