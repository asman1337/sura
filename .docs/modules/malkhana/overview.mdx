# Malkhana Evidence Management System

## Overview

Malkhana is the evidence storage and management system used by police departments in India. It serves as the official repository for all physical evidence, seized property, and case-related items. The Malkhana system employs a dual-registry approach to track items throughout their lifecycle - from initial seizure to final disposal.

## Key Concepts

### Registry Types

#### 1. Black Ink Registry

- **Purpose**: Records all items registered in the current calendar year
- **Lifespan**: Items remain in Black Ink registry only for the current year
- **Characteristics**: Active registry that receives new items and manages current cases

#### 2. Red Ink Registry

- **Purpose**: Maintains historical records of items from previous years
- **Lifespan**: Long-term storage of items spanning multiple years
- **Characteristics**: Archive registry that preserves chain of custody for older items

### Item Lifecycle

1. **Initial Registration**: 
   - Items are first registered in the Black Ink registry of the current year
   - Each item receives a permanent "motherNumber" (e.g., 2024-00012)
   - This motherNumber remains the primary identifier throughout the item's lifetime

2. **Annual Transition**:
   - At the beginning of a new year, all unresolved items from the previous year's Black Ink move to Red Ink
   - Example: When 2025 begins, all 2024 Black Ink items transfer to Red Ink

3. **Status Changes**:
   - **Disposal**: Items can be disposed of from either registry following court orders
   - **Movement**: Items may be temporarily removed for court proceedings or examination

### Numbering System

#### MotherNumber
- Permanent identifier assigned at first registration
- Format: `YYYY-NNNNN` (e.g., 2024-00012)
- Remains unchanged throughout the item's existence

#### Red Ink ID
- Sequential number assigned when an item enters the Red Ink registry
- Changes each year as the registry adjusts
- When items are disposed of, all subsequent Red Ink IDs are renumbered

Example:
- Red Ink has 100 items
- Item #50 is disposed
- Item #51 becomes #50, item #52 becomes #51, and so on

### Physical Organization

#### Shelf System
- Items are organized on shelves by category or sequential numbering
- Each shelf can be considered a logical grouping
- Shelves have their own identifiers and can contain multiple items

#### QR Code Integration
- **Shelf QR**: Scanning reveals all items stored on that shelf
- **Item QR**: Scanning provides detailed information about a specific item
- QR codes enable quick retrieval and inventory management

## Yearly Transition Process

The transition from Black Ink to Red Ink at year-end follows a specific procedure:

1. All undisposed items from current year's Black Ink are identified
2. These items retain their motherNumber but receive a new Red Ink ID
3. The items are physically moved to the Red Ink storage area
4. New Black Ink registry begins for the new year

Example:
- End of 2024: Black Ink has 10 items remaining
- Beginning of 2025: These 10 items move to Red Ink
- If Red Ink already had 99 items, these new items would be numbered #100-109

## Benefits of the Dual Registry System

1. **Clear Delineation**: Separates current and historical items
2. **Efficient Processing**: Focuses resources on current year items
3. **Comprehensive Tracking**: Maintains complete chain of custody
4. **Simplified Auditing**: Facilitates yearly inventory reconciliation

## Digital Implementation Considerations

For digital systems implementing Malkhana management:

1. **Automated Transitions**: Schedule year-end processing to move items between registries
2. **History Tracking**: Maintain all historical Red Ink IDs for each item
3. **QR Generation**: Automatically generate QR codes for new items and shelves
4. **Search Capabilities**: Enable search by motherNumber, current ID, or case details
5. **Disposal Workflow**: Implement proper authorization and documentation for item disposal
